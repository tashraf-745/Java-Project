      "Description": "Switzerland stands as a premier destination for migrants, particularly within Europe, owing to its robust economy, exceptional quality of life, and comparatively favorable tax regime. Approximately 30% of its population is foreign-born, a figure underscoring the country’s longstanding appeal to international residents. This attraction is reinforced by Switzerland’s high net migration index and liberal mobility frameworks—particularly the agreement on free movement with the EU and EFTA—which streamline immigration from neighboring states. Economic stability and a strong labor market continue to draw skilled professionals, while the nation’s scenic environment, healthcare infrastructure, and public safety further enhance its desirability. Although the cost of living is high, select cantonal tax policies offer advantageous conditions for expatriates. Migration to Switzerland is marked by both temporary and permanent flows, with many immigrants opting for long-term residence. Nonetheless, Swiss naturalization remains selective, favoring educated and highly skilled individuals, thereby shaping a migrant profile aligned with national economic priorities."

This influx has contributed to a population increase, with net immigration accounting for much of the growth between 2022 and 2023. However, Hong Kong is also experiencing a demographic shift, as many local residents emigrate, primarily to destinations like Canada, the United States, and the UK, driven by concerns over political instability and declining freedoms. This outflow, coupled with an influx of mainland Chinese immigrants, reflects changing migration patterns and underscores the socio-political factors shaping the region’s migration landscape."

Public attitudes toward immigration have traditionally been negative, with many Hungarians associating immigration with economic and social challenges. However, recent data shows a slight shift toward more positive views, with fewer people rejecting migrants outright. The growing need for foreign labor, particularly in Hungary’s burgeoning EV and battery industries, has forced the government to acknowledge the importance of migrant workers, despite its previous anti-immigrant rhetoric."
